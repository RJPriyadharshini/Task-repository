pip commands

Each line in the file typically consists of the package name and a version specifier. Here's what each part means:

Package Name: The name of the Python package you want to install.

Version Specifier: You can specify a version or version range to indicate which version(s) of the package should be installed. 
The version specifiers include:

==: Install a specific version.
>=: Install the specified version or a higher version.
<=: Install the specified version or a lower version.
<: Install a version lower than the specified version.
>: Install a version higher than the specified version.

requirements.tx
When you have a requirements.txt file, you can use it with pip to install all the specified packages and their versions 
in one go. For example, to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, you can run the following command:    pip install -r requirements.txt

This makes it easier to manage and replicate the environment for your Python project, ensuring that you have the right dependencies and versions
when you need to deploy your application on a different system or share it with others.
A requirements.txt file is a text document used to specify the Python packages and their versions that your project or application depends on.
